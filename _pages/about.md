**Biography**
======

I completed my Ph.D. at Shanghai University in 2022 under the guidance of [Prof. Xi Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RFDBl4kAAAAJ&hl=en). Additionally, I had the privilege of being a joint Ph.D. student with support from the CSC national scholarship at the University of Basque Country in 2021, where I was supervised and guided by [Prof. Evgeny Sherman](https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/quinst/people/-/asset_publisher/Jxs3/content/evgeny-sherman-ikerbasque-research-professor). Then, I worked with [Prof. Xiaopeng Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=p7i5fNoAAAAJ&hl=en) at the Shanghai Qizhi Institute in 2022. Currently, I am a postdoctoral researcher at Chalmers University of Technology, working in the field of quantum computing and information processing. Outside of academia, I have a passion for outdoor activities, particularly hiking and skiing. I look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead in combining my academic field with my personal interests.
